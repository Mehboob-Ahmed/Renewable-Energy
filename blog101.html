			<h2>How many different types of renewable energy are there?</h2>
			<p>The two main sources of renewable energy – or the ones you’ve most likely heard of before – are solar and wind power.</p>

				<p>Solar</p>
				
				<p>We use solar energy every day, from growing crops on farms to staying warm. Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are made of solar cells. A cell is a small disk of a semiconductor like silicon. They are attached by wire to a circuit. As light strikes the semiconductor, light is converted into electricity that flows through the circuit. As soon as the light is removed, the solar cell stops producing power.</p>
				
				<p>Wind</p>
				
				<p>We can also produce electricity through wind power. A wind turbine turns energy in the wind into electricity using the aerodynamic force created by the rotor blades, which work similarly to an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When the wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag. The force of the lift is stronger than the drag and this causes the rotor to spin. The rotor is connected to the generator, either directly (if it’s a direct drive turbine) or through a shaft and a series of gears (a gearbox) that speed up the rotation and allow for a physically smaller generator. This translation of aerodynamic force to rotation of a generator creates electricity.</p>
				
				<p>Hydropower, Biomass, Geothermal, and Tidal Energy</p>
				
				<p>Other less ‘mainstream’ sources of renewable energy are hydroelectric power, biomass energy, geothermal energy, and tidal energy.</p>
				
				<p>Like other forms of electricity generation, hydropower uses a turbine to help generate electricity; using the energy of falling or flowing water to turn the blades. The rotating blades spin a generator that converts the mechanical energy of the spinning turbine into electrical energy.</p>
				
				<p>Biomass contains stored energy from the sun. Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals. When biomass is burned, the chemical energy in biomass is released as heat. It can be burned directly or converted to liquid biofuels or biogas.
				</p>
				<p>According to the Geothermal Research Council, geothermal Energy is heat (thermal) derived from the earth (geo). It is the thermal energy contained in the rock and fluid that fills the fractures and pores within the rock of the earth’s crust. Deep wells are drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water. The steam and hot water are then brought to the surface for use in a variety of applications, including electricity generation, direct use, and heating and cooling.</p>
				
				<p>Tidal energy is produced by the surge of ocean waters during the rise and fall of tides. For most tidal energy generators, turbines are placed in tidal streams. A tidal stream is a fast-flowing body of water created by tides. A turbine is a machine that takes energy from a flow of fluid. That fluid can be air (wind) or liquid (water). Because water is much more dense than air, tidal energy is more powerful than wind energy. Unlike wind, tides are predictable and stable. Where tidal generators are used, they produce a steady, reliable stream of electricity.</p>
